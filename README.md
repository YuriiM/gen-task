# DELAYED EXECUTION

This README will guide you on how to run the app and interact with its API.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

## How to Run the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run `docker compose up --build` to build and start the application.

If some ports are already in use, you may change them in the `.env` file.

4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Swagger UI for API documentation by opening the following link in your web browser:

[Swagger UI](http://localhost:5000/)

The result of the execution will be available in the console where you ran Docker Compose. You will see the logs indicating the execution status and any relevant output.
